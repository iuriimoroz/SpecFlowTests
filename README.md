# Calculator with SpecFlow and NUnit

A simple **C# Calculator** project following Behavior-Driven Development (BDD) principles using **SpecFlow** and tested with **NUnit**. The project supports basic calculator operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- BDD scenarios written in **Gherkin** syntax.
- Step definitions using **SpecFlow** and **NUnit**.
- Shared context managed through a `CalculatorContext` class.

## Project Structure
- **Features/**: Contains Gherkin `.feature` files for each calculator operation.
- **Steps/**: Step definition classes for each operation.
- **Contexts/**: Shared state management through `CalculatorContext`.
